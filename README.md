# Clean Architecture Serverless Blog

**Clean Architecture Serverless Blog** is a highly maintainable and scalable blog application built with Express and TypeScript. This project adheres to Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Clean Architecture principles, ensuring separation of concerns and a modular codebase. The deployment is managed with Cloudformation, making it easy to deploy on AWS Lambda Functions.

## Overview

The **Clean Architecture Blog** is designed to be a robust and flexible blogging platform. By leveraging Clean Architecture and DDD, the application ensures that business logic is kept separate from implementation details, making it easier to maintain and scale. The infrastructure is defined as code using Terraform, allowing seamless deployment and management on AWS.

## Features
